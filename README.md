# MovieSite

MovieSite is a simple and interactive web application for exploring the latest movies. Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, this application fetches data from a movie API to display information such as ratings, trailers, and user comments. Users can search for movies, view ratings, read descriptions, and watch trailers. **Note**: MovieSite does not host or stream full movies.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Search for any movie by typing its title.
- **Movie Details**: View ratings, descriptions, and other relevant details.
- **Watch Trailers**: Watch official trailers for each movie.
- **Comments**: Add personal comments about each movie.
  
## Project Structure

- **frontend_movie_app/**: Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the front end.
- **backend_movie_app/**: Placeholder for future backend integration.
- **boilerplate-npm/**: Project setup files to manage dependencies.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/moviesite.git
   cd moviesite
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (if any)**:  
   In case any dependencies are used for testing or bundling in the future, ensure they are installed by running:

   ```

3. **Run the application**:  
   Open the `index.html` file in your browser to load the MovieSite interface.

## API Integration

This application uses a movie database API to fetch details about movies. Ensure that you have an API key and replace any placeholder keys in the JavaScript file with your own to fetch real-time movie data.

2. **View Details**: Click on a movie to view details like rating, description, and trailer link.
3. **Add Comments**: Use the comment section to add personal notes on each movie.

## Contributing

This project was initially built without frameworks. Contributions are welcome to improve the UI/UX, add backend support, or include additional features like user authentication.

## Future Enhancements

- **Backend Integration**: Store user comments persistently.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to log in and track their favorite movies.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Add filtering and sorting by genres, release year, etc.
